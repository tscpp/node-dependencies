# Node Dependencies
**Tree view of all dependencies installed in workspace.** Node Dependencies is an extension for [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [VS Code for short](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it manages dependencies and displays them in a tree view. The tree view will automatically update the tree view.
